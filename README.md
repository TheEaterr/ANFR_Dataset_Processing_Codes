# ANFR Dataset Processing - Source Code
This repository contains the source code for data processing of the ANFR dataset. The results of this source code are described in the paper (submitted for review at ICC2023) titled as **"The Long Road to Sobriety: Estimating the Operational Power Consumption of Cellular Base Stations in France"**. The contacts for the project include **Arsalan Ahmed** (<arsalanqasimahmed@gmail.com>) and **Dr. Marceau Coupechoux** (<marceau.coupechoux@telecom-paris.fr>) from Télécom Paris.


For details regarding the dataset and data processing, please consult the included PDF file.


Before running the source code, the following steps are to be completed:

- Firstly, three new folders should be created within the code directory. The first should be named as "ANFR Dataset", the second should be "Pre-processed data" and the last one should be "Graphs".
- Within the 'ANFR Dataset' folder, the entire ANFR dataset is to be placed. The dataset including the data and the reference files can be downloaded from the dataset website. The downloading process is tedious as the files for each month needs to be downloaded one by one.
- There are a few mistakes in the downloaded files from the ANFR website. Hence, for specific month's files, the following should be done manually:
  -**April 2022**: In the folder name, 2023 should be changed to 2022.
